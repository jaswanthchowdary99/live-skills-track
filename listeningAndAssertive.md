### Question 1: When do you act passively in your daily life?

Acting passively happens when you avoid expressing your thoughts or feelings because you're afraid of conflict or criticism. It's when you prioritize others' needs over your own and find it challenging to say no or share your concerns. This behavior may occur when you're afraid to disagree or hesitant to speak up.

### Question 2: When do you become aggressive in your daily interactions?

Being aggressive means you act forcefully and dominate in your interactions. This happens when you're very mad or frustrated, leading to confrontational and sometimes mean behavior. People may become aggressive when they feel disrespected, threatened, or when someone crosses their boundaries, resulting in actions like yelling, arguing, or being mean to others.

### Question 3: When do you show passive-aggressive behavior in your daily life?

Acting passive-aggressive occurs when you're upset but don't want to express it directly. Instead of openly discussing your feelings, you might use sarcasm, spread rumors, or give someone the silent treatment. People adopt this style to indicate their displeasure without engaging in direct confrontation.
